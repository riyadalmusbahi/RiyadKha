5-Minute Hummus
Here’s the scoop: this addictive chickpea dip is worlds better than what you get at the store. Though the recipe calls for adding two tablespoons of water, we like using chickpea water from the can for an extra boost of flavor. When your hummus is smooth and ready for serving, pour it into a bowl and grab a large spoon. Then, press the back of the spoon into the center of the hummus and rotate the bowl clockwise to create a small well. This not only elevates the presentation of the dip, but it allows a drizzle of olive oil to pool perfectly in the middle.
